# Minet
A mini neural network and matrix math JavaScript library. Built using JavaScript.

This was built as a project to deepen my understanding of deep learning and takes inspiration from the *Toy Neural Network Library* (https://github.com/CodingTrain/Toy-Neural-Network-JS). I will continue to add new features and improve the library.
Feel free to contribute to the project.
